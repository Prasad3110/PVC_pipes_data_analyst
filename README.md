# RAKSHA PIPES DATA ANALYSIS REPORT

# Project Overview
A demonstration of Python, SQL, and Power BI integration for data analysis and visualization.

# Data Generation
## Fake Data Generation (Python)
- Generated synthetic data using Python libraries like faker to simulate customers, orders,orderdetails ,categories ,shippers ,products ,payments and suppliers information.

# Database Design
## Database Creation (SQL)
- Created a SQL database using MySQL Workbench to store synthetic data.
- Execute the Raksha_Database.sql script to create the database schema.
- Imported the synthetic data into the MySQL Workbench. 

# Dashboard Creation
## Power BI Dashboard
- Connected Power BI to the MySQL Workbench.
- Imported necessary tables into PoerBI for analysis.
- Designed visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to analayze key metrics and trends.
- Arranged visualizations on the dashboard canvas to provide insights to stakeholders.
