# Database Design
## Database Creation (SQL)
- Created a SQL database using MySQL Workbench to store synthetic data.
- Execute the Raksha_Database.sql script to create the database schema.
- Imported the synthetic data into the MySQL Workbench. 

# Dashboard Creation
## Power BI Dashboard
- Connected Power BI to the MySQL Workbench.
- Imported necessary tables into PoerBI for analysis.
- Designed visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to analayze key metrics and trends.
- Arranged visualizations on the dashboard canvas to provide insights to stakeholders
  
We hope this structured outline has been helpful in navigating the setup process and leveraging the insights derived from the Raksha Pipes dataset.
